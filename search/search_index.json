Backend software that can handle specific requests and dynamically sends/recieves information to/from the user. Database that stores pretty much all information our app uses. There are endless configurations depending on the application. Sometimes, these components may be combined or further seperated to varying degrees. Regardless, all components must work together to produce a web app. Imagine a trinity of cards: Frontend , Backend , and Database . A developer that holds all three cards is said to have the \" Full Stack \", and thus can build a complete web app. What is Backend? In traditional web development, backend software runs the \"business logic\" of our app. For example, a basic workflow may be like this: The user fills out a login form on our app. The user's browser sends a login request + the credentials to the backend server. The backend recieves this information. The backend queries the database to see if the user exists. If the user exists, see if username & password match. If everything is correct, send our content back to the user. Otherwise, send an error message. Setting up a backend server is usually not easy. We would need to have extensive knowledge of setting up servers, networking, operating systems, and software. And that's before we even write any code, which may also require mastering multiple programming languages! This is not feasible without the proper expertise and lots of time. So we will not be doing that. Instead, we will leverage Cloud Services that do the hard work for us, so we can better focus on our ideas. Intro to Firebase Firebase is Google's solution to the problem. Firebase has reduced the entire Backend + Database stack into simpler services that we can rent out. Essentially, we are outsourcing all the hard technical work to Google. Getting Started Using Firebase is comparable to using any other Google cloud service like Gmail or Drive. First, we create a Project for our product. Then we can add different services such as Realtime Database or Authentication and create keys to be used by one or more Apps utilizng our Project's services. Creating a Project Sign in to firebase.google.com (feel free to use your UCSD account) Click Go to Console in the top right corner. Click Add Project . Fill out the forms and continue. Any name is ok. I recommend ECE196-Fall2020-IOT-YourName . Google Analytics is optional. We won't be using it, but it could be nice to have if we further develop the app later. Accept terms and conditions. Once everything is set up, it should look something similar to this. Adding Collaborators To add collaborators to the project, click on the Settings icon located on the top left. Select Users and permissions . Click the Add member button. As for roles, select either Owner or Editor . This can always be changed later. Once the member is added, they should receive an email invitation to join. Realtime Database Choosing a Database Firebase offers two different products for our Database needs. For the Free Plan as of 2020, here are the key similarities and differences: Spec Realtime Firestore Type NoSQL NoSQL Structure Basic JSON Documents & Collections Storage 10 GB 10 GB Bandwidth 10GiB/month 10GiB/month Simultaneous Connections 100 max No limit Document writes No limit 20K/day Document reads No limit 50K/day Document deletes No limit 20K/day A more in-depth comparison can be found here . We can also view pricing for paid plans here . For our application, we will pick Realtime Database . Basic JSON structure is easy to learn Not many users, but document I/O adds up fast. Creating a Database Open the Realtime Database service on the sidebar: Start in Test Mode . Click on the Rules tab and verify read and write access is set to true . Obtaining Keys Adding a Service Account To connect our Raspberry Pi to Firebase, we need to generate a Service Account key to use Firebase Admin SDK. Click on the project's Settings icon and click on Project Settings Navigate to the Service Accounts tab. Click Generate new Private Key . Save this project key somewhere where we can later copy it to the Raspberry Pi. Warning Your private key gives access to your project's Firebase services. Keep it confidential and never store it in a public repository. Store this file securely, because your new key can't be recovered if lost. If using Git, always add the name of this file to the project's .gitignore. Adding an App Also in Settings , under General tab and Your Apps section, click Add App . Select the Web platform. Fill out the form Any name is ok. I recommend Web App . We won't be using Firebase Hosting for now. (instead we'll use GitHub Pages later on) It should now spit out some info under Add Firebase SDK . The important part we care about is the var firebaseConfig dictionary. We can always come back to view this information anytime. const firebaseConfig = { apiKey: ... authDomain: ... databaseURL: ... projectId: ... storageBucket: ... messagingSenderId: ... appId: ... measurementId: ... }; We won't need this App key until the Frontend portion. Info Technically, none of the var firebaseConfig fields are sensitive information. In fact, this information will later be necessary for the end user to access our app. It is OK to commit this to the Git repository. Connecting to Firebase To send data to the cloud, our Raspberry Pi needs to connect to Firebase. We first import the libraries and initialize Firebase Admin: import firebase_admin from firebase_admin import credentials cred = credentials.Certificate( \u201cPATH_TO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE.json\u201d ) firebase_admin.initialize_app( cred, { \u201cdatabaseURL\u201d: \u201cLINK_TO_DATABASE_URL\u201d } ) Note replace the PATH_TO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE with the appropriate path replace the LINK_TO_DATABASE_URL with the appropriate URL Ues the following link to refer to the official documentation We also need to import the library for database and get a Reference. from firebase_admin import db db_ref = db.reference( \u201cPATH_TO_REFERENCE\u201d ) db_ref.set( VALUE ) data = db_ref.get() Note replace the PATH_TO_REFERENCE with the appropriate path replace VALUE with the appropriate value Complete Code Should look similar to this: import firebase_admin from firebase_admin import credentials from firebase_admin import db import Adafruit_DHT DHT_SENSOR = Adaruit_DHT.DHT22 DHT_PIN = 4 cred = credentials.Certificate( \u201cPATH_TO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE.json\u201d ) firebase_admin.initialize_app( cred, { \u201cdatabaseURL\u201d: \u201cLINK_TO_DATABASE_URL\u201d } ) while True: hum, temp = Adaruit_DHT.read_retry( DHT_SENSOR, DHT_PIN ) temp_ref = db.reference( \u201csensor/temperature\u201d ) temp_ref.set( temp ) hum_ref = db.reference( \u201csensor/humidity\u201d ) hum_ref.set( hum ) print( \u201cHumidity =\u201d, hum ) print( \u201cTemperature =\u201d, temp) time.sleep( 10 )","title":"Backend"},{"location":"fire/#intro-to-backend-development","text":"Written by Curtis Lee","title":"Intro to Backend Development"},{"location":"fire/#slides","text":"This browser does not support PDFs.

Brought to you by your favorite web browser! Fundamentals The most fundamental concepts of Web Development essentially boil down to these three (3): HTML The most basic building blocks of a webpage. Most atomic elements are various \"tags\" containing information. Tags can have attributes to assign special characteristics or functionality to them. Tags can be nested. The browser reads all these tags and builds a DOM (Document Object Model) Example: <html> <body> <h1 id=\"title\">I am a title font!</h2> <p>I am a paragraph of content!</p> </body> </html> CSS Tells the browser how to render the website. Makes it look good! Defined by \"selecting\" specific HTML tags and setting styling attributes to them. Tells the browser how to render elements of the DOM. Example: body { background-color: beige; text-align: center; } JavaScript Makes the website come alive! Can manipulate HTML elemeents in the DOM. Pieces of software (programming) that runs in the browser. Example: document.getElementById(\"title\").innerHTML = \"Hello JavaScript!\"; Getting Started Starting an HTML document from scratch is fairly straightforward. Create a new folder for your project. In the folder, create a empty text file named index.html and open it in VS Code. By copying and pasting the examples shown previously, adding some extra tags, we can make this: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>My App</title> </head> <style> body { background-color: beige; text-align: center; } </style> <body> <h1 id=\"title\">I am a title font!</h2> <p>I am a paragraph of content!</p> </body> <script> document.getElementById(\"title\").innerHTML = \"Hello JavaScript!\"; </script> </html> We can now open the file with a web browser to see the results. Notice: The background of the page is colored beige, and the text is centered on the page. This is consistent with the CSS styling we specified. The big <h1> text shows \"Hello JavaScript\", which is not the original text, but rather set by our JavaScript script. If we remove that JavaScript snippet from our page, this will no longer happen. We can also create more interesting behavior by changing the JavaScript. Try replacing the code in the <script> tag with this: setTimeout(function(){ document.getElementById(\"title\").innerHTML = \"Hello JavaScript!\"; }, 1000); And then save the file and refresh the page. Notice the text will now change after one (1) second! Important Most modern browsers have a \"lazy\" refresh that doesn't always reload all our changes. To actually refresh we have to perform a \"hard\" refresh which in Chrome can be done by holding down Shift and refreshing, or right clicking the refresh button. Serving the Website While opening the file as .html in the browser works for now, in later steps it will not be sufficient. We will need a proper HTTP server to serve the webpage. Luckily, we can use Python's built-in server: Open a terminal in the folder with the index.html file. Run python -m http.server In the browser, go to localhost:8000 The webpage should appear as before, but from a HTTP URL (of your own computer). Frameworks To bring order to the wild atomized world wrought by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, various competing powers have attempted to create structure with Web Frameworks. What are Frameworks? Usually open source projects, sometimes maintained by big corps (Google, Facebook, etc). Introduce a standarized way of writing patterns of code that occur frequently. Most importantly: greatly simplifies code and makes our lives easier! So many Frameworks! The World Wide Web is a fast paced world that changes frequently, and so do frameworks. Most frameworks commonly deployed today have only been created within the past decade. Choosing between the many competing options can be a daunting task. However to make our life easier and to get our app quickly off the ground without suffering too much learning curve, we are going to use this particular combination: Vue.js - HTML+JavaScript Framework Bootstrap - CSS framework Intro to Vue.js Vue is one of latest and greatest rising stars of the Frontend Framework scene. Compared to the more popular React or Angular, Vue is relatively easy to get working off the ground, without complicated setup. Adding Vue To include the Vue library into our page, we can use this script tag: <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.6.12\"></script> Since the browser loads the DOM in order, we must place this before we write any Javascript code that uses Vue. The best place in our current page is after <body> but before <script> . Tip If we open Developer Tools in our browser (F12 in Chrome), click the Console tab, we should now see some messages about Vue to confirm it was loaded successfully. After that, we can create a Vue object called vm (within the script block) like this: var vm = new Vue({}) Each Vue instance is defined by a dictionary with various fields specifying variables, functions, and special behavior. The ones we'll be using are: el - string name of id of the HTML tag to contain the app data - dictionary of variables used created - special function that runs when the app is created (similar to setup() in Arduino) methods - dictionary of methods/functions used So, before filling those fields, our instantiation should look like this: var vm = new Vue({ el: \"\", data: {}, created: function() {}, methods: {} }) For our HTML we want to create a new <div> element with id=\"app\" to wrap the content of our page. Then we declare el: \"app\" in our Vue object. Our code should now look like this: ... <body> <div id=\"app\"> <h1 id=\"title\">I am a title font!</h2> <p>I am a paragraph of content!</p> </div> </body> ... <script> var vm = new Vue({ el: \"#app\", data: {}, created: function() {}, methods: {} }) </script> ... Note: we can remove the JavaScript code from the previous section. One-Way Data Binding To witness the full power of Vue, we can set up what's called a data binding: Change the text in our <h1> to {{ titleText }} . Add a string titleText to data. Our code now: ... <body> <div id=\"app\"> <h1 id=\"title\">{{ titleText }}</h2> <p>I am a paragraph of content!</p> </div> </body> ... <script> var vm = new Vue({ el: \"#app\", data: { titleText: \"Hello World from Vue!\" }, created: function() {}, methods: {} }) </script> ... Now if we refresh the page we should see that Vue changes the titleText into what we specified! Tip Another useful perk of Vue is how easy it is to debug our application with the built-in browser Console. To open the console in Chrome, we can open Developer Tools or press F12 and click the Console tab. Our data fields are all properties of the Vue object, and since our Vue object is called vm , we can address titleText as vm.titleText Try typing vm.titleText into the console. What does it output? is this expected? Try typing vm.titleText = 'ECE 196' into the console. Now look at the HTML page. What is the <h1> text now? One of the most powerful advantages of Vue data binding is how values in the HTML and JavaScript portions of our webpage are seamlessly connected, in real time. If we wanted to achieve the same with pure JavaScript, it would not only take much more time writing and debugging more code, but the complexity would also grow exponentially when we add more stuff to our webpage. Two-Way Data Binding We just saw how to get Vue to put variables into HTML, but we also want to be able to put HTML variables into Vue. One way to do this is with two-way data binding. Before we do that, we need to create something in HTML designed to handle user input. One type of common input is the checkbox. We can add three checkboxes to the page like this: <div id=\"app\"> ... <label> <input type=\"checkbox\" v-model=\"color.r\"> Red </label> <label> <input type=\"checkbox\" v-model=\"color.g\"> Green </label> <label> <input type=\"checkbox\" v-model=\"color.b\"> Blue </label> </div> Next we want to declare variables in Vue for these values to go. One way we can do this is to add a dictionary under data with 3 boolean values like this: data: { ... color: { r: false, g: false, b: false } }, If we refresh the page, we should see our three checkboxes appear. Tip To verify that everything works we can use the console again: Tick an arbitrary combination of the boxes on our page type vm.color in the browser console expand the Observer object click each color field to load the value Is this what we'd expect? To make things really interesting we can reflect the values back onto our HTML page. Under the checkboxes, we can add another <p> like this: <p>Selected Values: {{ color }}</p> When the boxes are ticked, we can see the dictionary updated automatically on our page! Directives Directives are special HTML tag attributes that define behavior in Vue but are otherwise ignored by the browser. As you may have noticed in the previous section, we used the v-model directive to tell Vue that we want two-way data binding on our checkbox values. There are a multitude of other directives in Vue to accomplish all kinds of tasks, but we will only use a few ones here: v-model - creates two way data-binding v-if - displays an element only if the condition is true v-else - compliment for v-if v-on:change or @change - runs a function when the element is changed v-on:click or @click - runs a function when the element is clicked To see these in action, we can create some more HTML elements with Vue directives. Replace: <p>Selected Values: {{ color }}</p> with this: <button type=\"button\" v-on:click=\"selectAll(true)\">Select All</button> <p v-if=\"color.r || color.g || color.b\">Selected Values: {{ color }} </p> <p v-else>No colors are selected.</p> And in our Vue object, add a method called selectAll() that takes a parameter value like this: methods: { selectAll: function(value) { this.color.r = value; this.color.g = value; this.color.b = value; } } Info Since color is a field of vm , and the function runs within vm 's scope, we reference color as this.color Now when we refresh the page, we should see: Two-way data binding on the checkboxes still works. Different <p> element is shown if no checkboxes are ticked. Clicking the button will run a function that ticks all the checkboxes. Connecting to Firebase This sections assumes we already have a Firebase app set up. Adding Firebase To include the Firebase Core and Realtime Database libraries on our webpage, we can add the following lines similar to including the Vue library: <script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.21.0/firebase-app.js\"></script> <script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.21.0/firebase-database.js\"></script> Now outside and before our vm = new Vue() object, we need to initialize our objects called firebase and database : var firebaseConfig = { ... }; firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig); database = firebase.database() var vm = new Vue({ ... Replacing firebaseConfig with the one given in our Firebase App dashboard. Info It's possible to put the Firebase objects within our Vue object, but for our purposes it's easier to leave them seperate. Reading Data To read color data from Firebase, lets first add a new method in our Vue called setupColorListener() . This will create a listener in the background of our web app that listens for any changes in our database entry, and runs a function every time Firebase sends us these changes. setupColorListener: function() { var colorDataRef = database.ref('path/to/ref'); colorDataRef.on('value', function(snapshot) { vm.color = snapshot.val(); }); }, But note that so far our Firebase data is structured like this: Therefore, if we want the color data, our reference path should be changed to 'data/color' , which gives us: var colorDataRef = database.ref('data/color'); Info The callback function explicitly references color as vm.color and not this.color . This is because the callback is actually run within the Firebase object, which is outside the scope of vm . And we want the function to be run as soon as the page loads. So it makes sense to call the function under our created initialization function: created: function() { this.setupColorListener(); }, In Firebase Dashboard, if we now change the values within color , we should now see them update the checkboxes on our page, in real time! Writing Data While we can recieve data from Firebase, we also want changes to the checkboxes to also be sent to Firebase. This can be done with the v-on:change directive. Start by adding a new method called updateColor() in our Vue's methods: updateColor: function() { database.ref('data/color').set(this.color); } Next we want to enclose the checkboxes into a new form element with the directive like this: <form v-on:change=\"updateColor()\"> <label> <input type=\"checkbox\" v-model=\"color.r\"> Red </label> <label> <input type=\"checkbox\" v-model=\"color.g\"> Green </label> <label> <input type=\"checkbox\" v-model=\"color.b\"> Blue </label> </form> Similarily, we want to add an v-on:click directive to the button as well: <button type=\"button\" v-on:click=\"selectAll(true); updateColor()\">Select All</button> Every time Vue detects a change in the <form> containing all the checkboxes, it will run the function that submits the changed color dictionary. If we tick/untick any of the checkboxes, we should also be able to now see the values get updated in Firebase Dashboard as well! Intro to CSS There are two main ways to fine-tune the way our HTML elements look. The class attribute By assigning our element to a class value defined in <style> . We already have seen some of this in action. If we change our <style> block to this: <style> body { background-color: lightblue; } </style> We see that: The background color is changed to lightblue Everything reverts back to being left aligned, which is the default. The style attribute Can also inject some CSS properties directly into the tag. For very minor finer-tuning. For example this will center all the text inside the <div> : <div style=\"text-align: center;\"> I am centered text. </div> Fixing Loading Glitches When we refresh the page, sometimes we can still see {{ }} in the HTML before Vue loads. We can actually use a special Vue directive v-cloak along with some simple CSS to fix this. Add this to the style block: [v-cloak] { display: none; } And also add the directive onto the main <div> of the app: <div id=\"app\" v-cloak> Now the page will no longer flash those {{ }} before Vue loads. Intro to Bootstrap At this point you may have noticed our website overall still looks pretty unattractive. We could write more CSS from scratch to make our website look exactly how we want, but in most cases that's a waste of time. Instead, we can use another framework for CSS called Bootstrap. Bootstrap basically gives us a complete CSS stylesheet with designs for all the common UI elements to use in our app, including page layouts, fonts, buttons, textboxes, etc. Adding Bootstrap Similarly to including JavaScript, we can include CSS stylesheets before our existing <style> element like this: <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css\" integrity=\"sha384-JcKb8q3iqJ61gNV9KGb8thSsNjpSL0n8PARn9HuZOnIxN0hoP+VmmDGMN5t9UJ0Z\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"> When we refresh the page, we will immediately see the default font changed to a sans-serif type, the default for Bootstrap. To assign HTML tags style definitions from CSS, we add class attributes. Grid System Bootstrap's approach to page layout is a dynamic grid system. We can utilize this to improve the layout of the page. Here is an example of a basic 3 column layout: <div class=\"container\"> <div class=\"row\"> <div class=\"col-sm\"> One of three columns </div> <div class=\"col-sm\"> One of three columns </div> <div class=\"col-sm\"> One of three columns </div> </div> </div> One possible implementation on our page: Margins Margins are useful to put set amounts of space between different elements. In Bootstrap, margins can be specified with class attributes with two letters and a number like this: class=\"mt-5\" puts a margin on top of size 5 class=\"ml-2\" puts margin on the left of size 2 They can also be combined: class=\"mt-5 mb-5\" will put a margin on both top and bottom of size 5 We can also have margin on all sides: class=\"m-5\" will put a margin on all sides of size 5 We can wrap our page title in a 1x1 container and give it some margin from the top of the page like this: <div class=\"container mt-5\"> <div class=\"row\"> <div class=\"col-lg\" style=\"text-align: center;\"> <h1 id=\"title\">{{ titleText }}</h2> <p>I am a paragraph of content!</p> </div> </div> </div> Cards Cards are an all-purpose way to hold content. Different types of content can also be mix and matched in a card. Here is an example of a basic card: <div class=\"card\"> <img src=\"pi.jpg\" class=\"card-img-top\" alt=\"pi.jpg\"> <img src=\"pi.jpg\" class=\"card-img-top\" alt=\"pi.jpg\"> <div class=\"card-body\"> <h5 class=\"card-title\">Device: Raspberry Pi</h5> <p class=\"card-text\">The Raspberry Pi is awesome!</p> <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Learn More</a> </div> </div> </div> Combining cards with layouts we could create this: Tables To improve our display of the \"Selected Values\", we can convert it into a Bootstrap table. Creating a table can first be done with HTML tags like this: <table class=\"table\"> <thead class=\".thead-light\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">Type</th> <th scope=\"col\">Color</th> <th scope=\"col\">On</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td> <img class=\"icon\" src=\"led.png\" alt=\"led\"> </td> <td>Red</td> <td> <input type=\"checkbox\" v-model=\"color.r\" v-on:change=\"updateColor()\"> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <img class=\"icon\" src=\"led.png\" alt=\"led\"> </td> <td>Green</td> <td> <input type=\"checkbox\" v-model=\"color.g\" v-on:change=\"updateColor()\"> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <img class=\"icon\" src=\"led.png\" alt=\"led\"> </td> <td>Blue</td> <td> <input type=\"checkbox\" v-model=\"color.b\" v-on:change=\"updateColor()\"> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Info Lists or tabular data of large or arbitrary sizes should be generated using the v-for directive (akin to a for loop), but since we aren't using any we won't go over it in this course. Also, to get the icons to display properly, add this class to our custom <style> block: .icon { width: 2em; height: 2em; } Adding the table to one of the cards shown previously could look like this: Buttons Bootstrap also give us templates for buttons, as well as \"button groups\" which can combine adjacent buttons into a single bar. <div class=\"btn-group\" role=\"group\"> <button v-on:click=\"selectAll(true); updateColor();\" type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\">Select All</button> <button v-on:click=\"selectAll(false); updateColor();\" type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\">Deselect All</button> </div> Lists We can use Bootstrap List Groups on top of an HTML list to make our sensor data card look nice. <ul class=\"list-group\"> <li class=\"list-group-item\">Temperature: 40C </li> <li class=\"list-group-item\">Humidity: 50%</li> </ul> Final Touches To make all the cards the same height we can add d-flex to each column <div> , and then add w-100 to each card <div> so that the fill the column properly, like this: ... <div class=\"col-sm d-flex\"> <div class=\"card w-100\"> ... Info Fine tuning layout specifics can get very time consuming so we won't go over too many tricky details. Also replacing the checkboxes with toggle switches are a nice touch: <div v-on:change=\"updateColor()\" class=\"custom-control custom-switch\"> <input v-model=\"color.r\" type=\"checkbox\" class=\"custom-control-input\" id=\"color-r\"> <label class=\"custom-control-label\" for=\"color-r\"></label> </div> <div v-on:change=\"updateColor()\" class=\"custom-control custom-switch\"> <input v-model=\"color.g\" type=\"checkbox\" class=\"custom-control-input\" id=\"color-g\"> <label class=\"custom-control-label\" for=\"color-g\"></label> </div> <div v-on:change=\"updateColor()\" class=\"custom-control custom-switch\"> <input v-model=\"color.b\" type=\"checkbox\" class=\"custom-control-input\" id=\"color-b\"> <label class=\"custom-control-label\" for=\"color-b\"></label> </div> Finally, its a good idea to associate color with each entry on the LED table with some inline style attributes: style=\"background-color: lightcoral;\" style=\"background-color: lightgreen;\" style=\"background-color: lightskyblue;\" Here is what the final result can look like: Hosting on Github Pages to do Open terminal in project folder git init git remote add origin <git ssh url here> git add . git commit -m first commit! git push Info To upload updated code, repeat steps 4-6 and replace \"first commit!\" with a brief description of the new changes. Conclusion The content in this guide is by no means all-inclusive. In fact, we barely scratched the surface of what these frameworks have to offer. For more features and help it's definitely worth looking at the documentation these products.","title":"Frontend"},{"location":"web/#intro-to-frontend-development","text":"Written by Curtis Lee The modern World Wide Web is truly a world of chaos and anarchy, with competing powers rising and falling, along with their preferred way of doing things. Brought to you by your favorite web browser!","title":"Intro to Frontend Development"},{"location":"web/#fundamentals","text":"The most fundamental concepts of Web Development essentially boil down to these three (3): HTML The most basic building blocks of a webpage. Most atomic elements are various \"tags\" containing information. Tags can have attributes to assign special characteristics or functionality to them. Tags can be nested. The browser reads all these tags and builds a DOM (Document Object Model) Example: <html> <body> <h1 id=\"title\">I am a title font!</h2> <p>I am a paragraph of content!</p> </body> </html> CSS Tells the browser how to render the website. Makes it look good! Defined by \"selecting\" specific HTML tags and setting styling attributes to them. Tells the browser how to render elements of the DOM. Example: body { background-color: beige; text-align: center; } JavaScript Makes the website come alive! Can manipulate HTML elemeents in the DOM. Pieces of software (programming) that runs in the browser. Example: document.getElementById(\"title\").innerHTML = \"Hello JavaScript!\";","title":"Fundamentals"},{"location":"web/#getting-started","text":"Starting an HTML document from scratch is fairly straightforward. Create a new folder for your project. In the folder, create a empty text file named index.html and open it in VS Code. By copying and pasting the examples shown previously, adding some extra tags, we can make this: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>My App</title> </head> <style> body { background-color: beige; text-align: center; } </style> <body> <h1 id=\"title\">I am a title font!</h2> <p>I am a paragraph of content!</p> </body> <script> document.getElementById(\"title\").innerHTML = \"Hello JavaScript!\"; </script> </html> We can now open the file with a web browser to see the results. Notice: The background of the page is colored beige, and the text is centered on the page. This is consistent with the CSS styling we specified. The big <h1> text shows \"Hello JavaScript\", which is not the original text, but rather set by our JavaScript script. If we remove that JavaScript snippet from our page, this will no longer happen. We can also create more interesting behavior by changing the JavaScript. Try replacing the code in the <script> tag with this: setTimeout(function(){ document.getElementById(\"title\").innerHTML = \"Hello JavaScript!\"; }, 1000); And then save the file and refresh the page. Notice the text will now change after one (1) second! Important Most modern browsers have a \"lazy\" refresh that doesn't always reload all our changes. To actually refresh we have to perform a \"hard\" refresh which in Chrome can be done by holding down Shift and refreshing, or right clicking the refresh button.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"web/#serving-the-website","text":"While opening the file as .html in the browser works for now, in later steps it will not be sufficient.

Compared to the more popular React or Angular, Vue is relatively easy to get working off the ground, without complicated setup.","title":"Intro to Vue.js"},{"location":"web/#adding-vue","text":"To include the Vue library into our page, we can use this script tag: <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.6.12\"></script> Since the browser loads the DOM in order, we must place this before we write any Javascript code that uses Vue. The best place in our current page is after <body> but before <script> . Tip If we open Developer Tools in our browser (F12 in Chrome), click the Console tab, we should now see some messages about Vue to confirm it was loaded successfully. After that, we can create a Vue object called vm (within the script block) like this: var vm = new Vue({}) Each Vue instance is defined by a dictionary with various fields specifying variables, functions, and special behavior. The ones we'll be using are: el - string name of id of the HTML tag to contain the app data - dictionary of variables used created - special function that runs when the app is created (similar to setup() in Arduino) methods - dictionary of methods/functions used So, before filling those fields, our instantiation should look like this: var vm = new Vue({ el: \"\", data: {}, created: function() {}, methods: {} }) For our HTML we want to create a new <div> element with id=\"app\" to wrap the content of our page. Then we declare el: \"app\" in our Vue object. Our code should now look like this: ... <body> <div id=\"app\"> <h1 id=\"title\">I am a title font!</h2> <p>I am a paragraph of content!</p> </div> </body> ... <script> var vm = new Vue({ el: \"#app\", data: {}, created: function() {}, methods: {} }) </script> ...

Now if we refresh the page we should see that Vue changes the titleText into what we specified! Tip Another useful perk of Vue is how easy it is to debug our application with the built-in browser Console. To open the console in Chrome, we can open Developer Tools or press F12 and click the Console tab. Our data fields are all properties of the Vue object, and since our Vue object is called vm , we can address titleText as vm.titleText Try typing vm.titleText into the console. What does it output? is this expected? Try typing vm.titleText = 'ECE 196' into the console. Now look at the HTML page. What is the <h1> text now? One of the most powerful advantages of Vue data binding is how values in the HTML and JavaScript portions of our webpage are seamlessly connected, in real time. If we wanted to achieve the same with pure JavaScript, it would not only take much more time writing and debugging more code, but the complexity would also grow exponentially when we add more stuff to our webpage.","title":"One-Way Data Binding"},{"location":"web/#two-way-data-binding","text":"We just saw how to get Vue to put variables into HTML, but we also want to be able to put HTML variables into Vue.

Here is an example of a basic card: <div class=\"card\"> <img src=\"pi.jpg\" class=\"card-img-top\" alt=\"pi.jpg\"> <img src=\"pi.jpg\" class=\"card-img-top\" alt=\"pi.jpg\"> <div class=\"card-body\"> <h5 class=\"card-title\">Device: Raspberry Pi</h5> <p class=\"card-text\">The Raspberry Pi is awesome!</p> <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Learn More</a> </div> </div> </div> Combining cards with layouts we could create this:","title":"Cards"},{"location":"web/#tables","text":"To improve our display of the \"Selected Values\", we can convert it into a Bootstrap table. Creating a table can first be done with HTML tags like this: <table class=\"table\"> <thead class=\".thead-light\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">Type</th> <th scope=\"col\">Color</th> <th scope=\"col\">On</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td> <img class=\"icon\" src=\"led.png\" alt=\"led\"> </td> <td>Red</td> <td> <input type=\"checkbox\" v-model=\"color.r\" v-on:change=\"updateColor()\"> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <img class=\"icon\" src=\"led.png\" alt=\"led\"> </td> <td>Green</td> <td> <input type=\"checkbox\" v-model=\"color.g\" v-on:change=\"updateColor()\"> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <img class=\"icon\" src=\"led.png\" alt=\"led\"> </td> <td>Blue</td> <td> <input type=\"checkbox\" v-model=\"color.b\" v-on:change=\"updateColor()\"> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Info Lists or tabular data of large or arbitrary sizes should be generated using the v-for directive (akin to a for loop), but since we aren't using any we won't go over it in this course. Also, to get the icons to display properly, add this class to our custom <style> block: .icon { width: 2em; height: 2em; } Adding the table to one of the cards shown previously could look like this:","title":"Tables"},{"location":"web/#buttons","text":"Bootstrap also give us templates for buttons, as well as \"button groups\" which can combine adjacent buttons into a single bar. <div class=\"btn-group\" role=\"group\"> <button v-on:click=\"selectAll(true); updateColor();\" type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\">Select All</button> <button v-on:click=\"selectAll(false); updateColor();\" type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\">Deselect All</button> </div>","title":"Buttons"},{"location":"web/#lists","text":"We can use Bootstrap List Groups on top of an HTML list to make our sensor data card look nice. <ul class=\"list-group\"> <li class=\"list-group-item\">Temperature: 40C </li> <li class=\"list-group-item\">Humidity: 50%</li> </ul>","title":"Lists"},{"location":"web/#final-touches","text":"To make all the cards the same height we can add d-flex to each column <div> , and then add w-100 to each card <div> so that the fill the column properly, like this: ... <div class=\"col-sm d-flex\"> <div class=\"card w-100\"> ... Info Fine tuning layout specifics can get very time consuming so we won't go over too many tricky details. Also replacing the checkboxes with toggle switches are a nice touch: <div v-on:change=\"updateColor()\" class=\"custom-control custom-switch\"> <input v-model=\"color.r\" type=\"checkbox\" class=\"custom-control-input\" id=\"color-r\"> <label class=\"custom-control-label\" for=\"color-r\"></label> </div> <div v-on:change=\"updateColor()\" class=\"custom-control custom-switch\"> <input v-model=\"color.g\" type=\"checkbox\" class=\"custom-control-input\" id=\"color-g\"> <label class=\"custom-control-label\" for=\"color-g\"></label> </div> <div v-on:change=\"updateColor()\" class=\"custom-control custom-switch\"> <input v-model=\"color.b\" type=\"checkbox\" class=\"custom-control-input\" id=\"color-b\"> <label class=\"custom-control-label\" for=\"color-b\"></label> </div> Finally, its a good idea to associate color with each entry on the LED table with some inline style attributes: style=\"background-color: lightcoral;\" style=\"background-color: lightgreen;\" style=\"background-color: lightskyblue;\" Here is what the final result can look like:","title":"Final Touches"},{"location":"web/#hosting-on-github-pages","text":"to do Open terminal in project folder git init git remote add origin <git ssh url here> git add . git commit -m first commit! git push Info To upload updated code, repeat steps 4-6 and replace \"first commit!\" with a brief description of the new changes.","title":"Hosting on Github Pages"},{"location":"web/#conclusion","text":"The content in this guide is by no means all-inclusive.
