# Data Visualization Methods
_Written by Curtis Lee_

We are able acquire tons of data with our DHT22 sensor, and potentially other sensor modules, however, currently they are not being recorded or visualized over time.

We can create more advanced views of our data with yet another JavaScript framework called [**Chart.js**](https://www.chartjs.org/). With Chart.js we can create good looking and interactive [graphs of all types](https://www.chartjs.org/samples/latest/).
